# SQL-Table-Creation
In this project, I created a SQL table called 'friends' to practice database operations. I inserted, updated, and deleted records, added an email column, and used SELECT to view results. The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations and good table design using a PRIMARY KEY for data integrity.
# 🗂️ SQL Friends Table Project

## 📘 Description

This project demonstrates how to create and interact with a basic SQL table named `friends`. The table includes key fields like ID, name, birthday, and email. I performed common SQL operations such as:

- Creating a table with constraints
- Inserting multiple records
- Updating specific values
- Deleting a record
- Viewing the final results using a SELECT statement

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of SQL and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a hands-on way.

## 🛠️ Features

- `CREATE TABLE` with a `PRIMARY KEY` for data integrity
- `INSERT INTO` to add data to the table
- `UPDATE` to modify specific fields
- `DELETE FROM` to remove a row
- `SELECT *` to view results
- Realistic sample data with valid formatting

## 📄 Example Output

Final table after operations:

## 💡 How to Use

1. Copy the code from `friends.sql`.
2. Run it in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or an online SQL editor).
3. Observe how data is added, changed, and removed from the `friends` table.

## 🚀 Extend the Project

Feel free to:
- Add more columns (e.g., phone number, address)
- Add more friends
- Create related tables (e.g., hobbies, locations)
- Add constraints like `NOT NULL` or `UNIQUE`
