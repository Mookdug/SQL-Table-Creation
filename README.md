# SQL-Table-Creation
In this project, I created a SQL table called 'friends' to practice database operations. I inserted, updated, and deleted records, added an email column, and used SELECT to view results. The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations and good table design using a PRIMARY KEY for data integrity.
